# I can't sell leftover spot assets

### Reasoning&#x20;

* Each spot deployer sets the minimum lot size for trading.&#x20;
* For JEFF, the minimum lot size is 1, so you cannot sell less than that on the order book. If you have <1 JEFF that you would like to sell, you can use a community member’s site that swaps JEFF for USDC: <https://www.heyjeff.fun/>
* For RUB, you can only sell in units of 0.00001
* For XAUT, the minimum lot size is 0.01, so you cannot sell less than that on the order book. You can try transferring to the HyperEVM and swapping it on protocols there or bridge out using <https://gold.usdt0.to/transfer>
