# Permissionless spot quote assets

Becoming a spot quote asset is permissionless.&#x20;

The requirements for becoming a permissionless spot quote asset are as follows:

1. Wei decimals of 8 and size decimals of 2
2. Zero deployer fee share on the quote token
3. 200k HYPE staked, subject to the following slashing criteria based on validator voting:&#x20;
   1. A peg mechanism to a price of 1 USD. A future network upgrade could increase the scope to other non-dollar stable assets&#x20;
      1. QUOTE/USDC should have 100k USDC size on both sides within the price range from 0.998 and 1.002, inclusive&#x20;
      2. QUOTE/USDC should have 1M USDC size on both sides within 0.99 and 1.01, inclusive&#x20;
   2. A liquid HYPE/QUOTE book&#x20;
      1. HYPE/QUOTE should have 50k QUOTE size on both sides within a spread of 0.5%, inclusive

USDC and USDT are not subject to the staking requirement due to their longstanding track record and established scale.&#x20;

The 200k HYPE staked by the deployer are subject to slashing based on validator vote for poor quality quote assets. Upon deployment, this stake is committed for 3 years, after which it can be unstaked. This gives builders and users some assurance when choosing a quote asset.&#x20;

For any of the conditions above, if there is a three-day period during which the condition is not satisfied for a majority of uniformly-spaced 1 second samples, the quote asset will be considered slashable. Validators will vote on the amount to slash when such conditions are violated.&#x20;

Becoming a quote asset is now permissionless on testnet, where the staking requirement is 50 HYPE for ease of testing. Once the requirements above are met, the token deployer sends an `enableQuoteToken` transaction to convert the token into a quote token. This deployer action is irreversible and has no gas cost.&#x20;

Transfer fees for new accounts can be paid in 1 unit of a spot quote asset.
