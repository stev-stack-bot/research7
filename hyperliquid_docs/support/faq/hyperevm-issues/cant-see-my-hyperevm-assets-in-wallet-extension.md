# Can’t see my HyperEVM assets in wallet extension

Here is a guide with common questions regarding how to use the HyperEVM: <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/how-to-use-the-hyperevm>

### Add HyperEVM to your wallet extension

Follow the steps below or using Chainlist: <https://chainlist.org/chain/999>

* Add the chain to your wallet using "Add custom network":&#x20;
* Chain ID: 999&#x20;
* Network Name: Hyperliquid&#x20;
* RPC URL: <https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm&#x20>;
* Currency Symbol: HYPE

### For specific HyperEVM asset - add custom network token <a href="#custom-network-token" id="custom-network-token"></a>

* Click the wallet icon (see below) to the right of the Contract in the info bar for a given spot asset on the Trade page

* To do this manually, you can add the contract address for a token directly to your wallet extension. You can find the contract address for a given token using a HyperEVM explorer, such as <https://www.hyperscan.com/token/0x9b498C3c8A0b8CD8BA1D9851d40D186F1872b44E> or <https://purrsec.com/address/0x9b498c3c8a0b8cd8ba1d9851d40d186f1872b44e> for PURR &#x20;

If you have tried the above, but your wallet extension does not support the HyperEVM as a custom network, consider using Rabby, which supports the HyperEVM as an integrated network: <https://support.rabby.io/en/articles/14120403-migrating-from-metamask-or-other-wallets>
