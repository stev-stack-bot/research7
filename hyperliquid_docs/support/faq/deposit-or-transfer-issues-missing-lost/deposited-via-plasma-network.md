# Deposited via Plasma network

* The Plasma address can only receive XPL on the Plasma network. Deposits other than XPL or on other networks will fail and not be credited, e.g., Depositing USDC on Plasma will fail and not be credited.
  * If you accidentally sent USDT0 on Plasma, you can try Unit's revert feature: <https://app.hyperunit.xyz/revert>. Instructions can be found here: <https://docs.hyperunit.xyz/how-to/revert>.&#x20;
  * If you accidentally sent another asset that is not supported on Plasma or sent XPL on a chain other than Plasma, there isn't a way to retrieve these assets currently, unless Unit adds support for them.
  * If you sent the right token on the right chain and deposited more than the minimum amount, but your XPL still shows up as “Failed", reach out to the Unit team, which manages Plasma network deposits & withdrawals: [https://app.hyperunit.xyz/support](<https://app.hyperunit.xyz/support >)​
* There is a minimum deposit of 60 XPL. Deposits below 60 XPL will result in a loss of funds.
* Note that Plasma deposits take \~1 minute to arrive in your wallet. You can check the time estimate in the same deposit pop-up where you copied the deposit address.
