# Historical data

### Exporting additional user trade history

The Enigma team has built an interface for users to export trade history <https://trade-export.hypedexer.com/?v=1>. This is a third-party integration that is independently maintained. Any issues or feedback should be reported directly to the maintainers.&#x20;

### Market Data (for advanced users)

The examples below use the AWS CLI (see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html>) and LZ4 (<https://github.com/lz4/lz4> or install from your package manager).

Note that the requester of the data must pay for transfer costs.

#### Asset data

Historical data is uploaded to the bucket `hyperliquid-archive`  approximately once a month. **There is no guarantee of timely updates and data may be missing.**&#x20;

L2 book snapshots are available in market\_data and asset contexts are available in asset\_ctxs. No other historical data sets are provided via S3 (e.g. candles or spot asset data). You can use the API to record additional historical data sets yourself.&#x20;

Format: `s3://hyperliquid-archive/market_data/[date]/[hour]/[datatype]/[coin].lz4` or `s3://hyperliquid-archive/asset_ctxs/[date].csv.lz4`

```
aws s3 cp s3://hyperliquid-archive/market_data/20230916/9/l2Book/SOL.lz4 /tmp/SOL.lz4 --request-payer requester
unlz4 --rm /tmp/SOL.lz4
head /tmp/SOL
```

#### Trade data

`s3://hl-mainnet-node-data/node_fills_by_block` has fills which are streamed via `--write-fills --batch-by-block` from a non-validating node. Older data is in a different format at `s3://hl-mainnet-node-data/node_fills)` and `s3://hl-mainnet-node-data/node_trades` . `node_fills` matches the API format, while `node_trades` does not.

#### Historical node data

`s3://hl-mainnet-node-data/explorer_blocks` and `s3://hl-mainnet-node-data/replica_cmds` contain historical explorer blocks and L1 transactions.

&#x20;`s3://hl-mainnet-node-data/misc_events_by_block` contains non-trade events such as transfers, staking, and funding.
