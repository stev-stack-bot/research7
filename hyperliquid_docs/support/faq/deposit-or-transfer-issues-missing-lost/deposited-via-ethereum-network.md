# Deposited via Ethereum network

* The Ethereum address can only receive ETH/ENA on the Ethereum network. Deposits other than ETH/ENA or on other networks will fail and not be credited, e.g., Depositing USDC on Ethereum or ETH on Base will fail and not be credited.
  * If you accidentally sent USDC, USDT, or WETH on Ethereum or ETH on Arbitrum, you can try Unit's revert feature: <https://app.hyperunit.xyz/revert>. Instructions can be found here: <https://docs.hyperunit.xyz/how-to/revert>.&#x20;
  * If you accidentally sent another asset that is not supported on Ethereum or sent ETH/ENA on a chain other than Ethereum, there isn't a way to retrieve these assets currently, unless Unit adds support for them.
  * If you sent the right token on the right chain and deposited more than the minimum amount, but your ETH/ENA still shows up as “Failed", reach out to the Unit team, which manages Ethereum network deposits & withdrawals: [https://app.hyperunit.xyz/support](<https://app.hyperunit.xyz/support >)
* There are minimum deposits of 0.007 ETH and 120 ENA. Deposits below these amounts will result in a loss of funds.
* Note that Ethereum deposits take \~5 minutes to arrive in your wallet. You can check the time estimate in the same deposit pop-up where you copied the deposit address.
