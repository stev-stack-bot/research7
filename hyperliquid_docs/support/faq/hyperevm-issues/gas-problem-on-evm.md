# Gas problem on EVM

### **What is used for gas for HyperEVM?** <a href="#gas-on-hyperevm" id="gas-on-hyperevm"></a>

* The gas for EVM transfers and transactions on the HyperEVM is HYPE
* To transfer tokens from HyperCore to EVM, you will need HYPE on HyperCore (Spot)
* To transfer tokens from EVM to HyperCore and other transactions on the HyperEVM, you will need HYPE on the HyperEVM

### **Situation 1: I see this error “Invalid transaction envelope type: specified type “0x2” but included a gasPrice instead of maxFeePerGas and maxPriorityFeePerGas”** <a href="#gas-issue-metamask" id="gas-issue-metamask"></a>

* This is a known issue with MetaMask; you can try a different wallet like Rabby: <https://support.rabby.io/en/articles/14120403-migrating-from-metamask-or-other-wallets>

### **Situation 2: Why does my wallet indicate that I have insufficient ETH balance for transactions when I do in my wallet?** <a href="#eth-gas-issues" id="eth-gas-issues"></a>

* You don't need ETH for gas on the HyperEVM. You need HYPE for gas on the HyperEVM
* Usually this means you didn't add the HyperEVM network properly to your wallet extension. Please follow the instructions here: <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/onboarding/how-to-use-the-hyperevm#how-do-i-add-the-hyperevm-to-my-wallet-extension>
* Your wallet extension may not support the HyperEVM as a custom network. Consider switching to Rabby, which supports the HyperEVM as an integrated network: <https://support.rabby.io/en/articles/14120403-migrating-from-metamask-or-other-wallets>
